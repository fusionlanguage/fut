Fusion Programming Language
===========================

Fusion is a programming language designed for implementing reusable components
(libraries) for C, C++, C#, D, Java, JavaScript, Python, Swift, TypeScript
and OpenCL C, all from single codebase.

A "Hello, world" library:

```csharp
public class HelloFu
{
    public static string GetMessage()
    {
        return "Hello, world!";
    }
}
```

can be translated to all the listed languages with:
```
fut -o hello.c,cpp,cs,d,java,js,py,swift,ts,cl hello.fu
```

The translated code is lightweight (no virtual machine, emulation nor
dependencies), human-readable and fits well with the target language,
including naming conventions and documentation comments.
