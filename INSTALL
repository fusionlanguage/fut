How to compile and test cito
============================

cito is currently written in C#.

You can build it with .NET 6.0 on Windows/macOS/Linux
or .NET Framework on Windows only.
The Mono compiler doesn't work (reports a NotImplementedException).

On Windows install Visual Studio 2022.
On other platforms install .NET 6.0 SDK (https://dotnet.microsoft.com/)

Build cito with the following command line:

    dotnet build

Alternatively, if you have GNU Make, build using:

    make

On Windows, this will build for .NET Framework.
On other platforms it is equivalent to "dotnet build".

## Testing

To run cito tests, you will need:
* GNU Make
* perl
* GNU diff
* Clang C and C++ compilers
* Visual Studio 2022 or Mono
* Java compiler (https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/)
* Node.js (https://nodejs.org/)
* Python
* Swift (https://swift.org/)
* GLib (https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/GLib)

To get GNU Make, perl, GNU diff, Clang, Python and GLib on Windows,
install MSYS2 (https://www.msys2.org/), start "MSYS2 MinGW 64-bit"
and add packages with:

    pacman -S make perl diffutils mingw-w64-x86_64-clang mingw-w64-x86_64-python mingw-w64-x86_64-glib2

Run the tests with:

    make test

The -jN option is supported and strongly recommended.
